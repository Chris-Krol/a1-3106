Please answer the following questions in the technical document. Explain why your answers are correct.


The technical document will be worth 40 marks, allocated as described above.
1.Briefly describe how your implementation works. Include information on any important algorithms, design decisions, data structures, etc. used in your implementation. [10 marks]
    Store nodes as objects of a class in a list. 
    Find the start and goal node.
    Calculate the heuristic for each node
    [Obstacles and hazards...]
    

2. What type of agent have you implemented (simple reflex agent, model-based reflex agent, goal-based agent, or utility-based agent)? [3 marks]
    Goal based...

3. What heuristic should be used for A* search for this environment? Show that this heuristic is consistent. Show that this heuristic is more informed than some alternative heuristic. [8 marks]

4. Suggest a particular instance of this problem where A* search would find the optimal solution faster than uniform cost search. [4 marks]

5. Suggest a particular instance of this problem where a greedy heuristic search would not find the optimal solution. [4 marks]

6. What strategy should be used to break ties when two nodes on the frontier have equal priority function? [3 marks]

7. Consider a variant of this problem where the agent can move to adjacent diagonal squares. What would be the best heuristic to use in A* search if the agent could also make such diagonal moves? [8 marks]
    "On a square grid that allows 8 directions of movement, use Diagonal distance (Lâˆž)....
